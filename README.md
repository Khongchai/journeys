This is a research blog for my senior violin recital. The website is written with Gatsby and currently hosted on Github Pages.

With the custom-made side bar, the focus of this web page is to make long block of text as inviting as possible, from the color selection to the way it functions.

The timeline, dynamically generated CSS Grid content, should also allow for easier navigation through chronological events.
