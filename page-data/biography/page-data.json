After having been so long under the influence of Nicholas Rubinstein, having to cater to almost all his needs nights and days, he finally had the chance to emancipate himself, get himself a room and a servant.

Around the middle of the year, after the performance of his Festival Cantata at the opening of the Polytechnic Exhibition, he left Moscow for Kamenka, where he often went to seek refuge from the hubbub of town life. It was here that he started one of his most Russian compositions, the Second Symphony, before finishing it in Moscow in August. The Second Symphony, according to his brother, was the result of the influence of the Mighty Five. Here, Tchaikovsky used 3 Ukrainian folk songs: Down by the Mother Volga (\\u0412\\u043D\\u0438\\u0437 \\u043F\\u043E \\u043C\\u0430\\u0442\\u0443\\u0448\\u043A\\u0435, \\u043F\\u043E \\u0412\\u043E\\u043B\\u0433\\u0435), Spin O My Spinner (\\u041F\\u0440\\u044F\\u0434\\u0438, \\u043F\\u0440\\u044F\\u0445\\u0430), and a very famous Ukrainian folk song The Crane (\\u0416\\u0443\\u0440\\u0430\\u0432\\u0435\\u043B\\u044C). The symphony was deemed by many as one of his best works. And appealed to many Russians due to its nationalistic quality.

His journalism showed his grasp of literary work, as evidenced by his childhood, he had always had a knack for written literature and was even able to speak and read German and French before his native tongue had reached fluency.

Tchaikovsky, pg. 131) Fortunately for Tchaikovsky, after having worked so hard on The Oprichnik, the opera was unanimously accepted by the Capellmeisters the Imperial theater and Opera. As someone who loved literature, Tchaikovsky was always in pursuit of a topic for new operas. On December 30th, he received a letter from Vladimir Stassov, one of the most respected music critics, detailing what he thought could serve as the topic for Tchaikovsky\\u2019s next big opera: The Tempest. To which Tchaikovsky took much interest in and eventually composed an opera based on Stassov\\u2019s detailed description of the scenes: \\u201CIn the introduction I picture it to myself as calm, until Prospero works his spell and the storm begins.

He dreaded the thought of losing all trace of experience each day had had for him. He jotted down notes of what he thought was interesting, committed himself to preserve the very thing he held dear. This was the year he began experimenting with his diary. The very day he left his friend\\u2019s estate in Nizy, a town in the Sumy district in Ukraine (M.Tchaikovsky, pg. 140). In his diary, his thoughts are expressed with more frankness than in his letters to his friends or family; unfortunately, most of his diary was destroyed by himself. Nonetheless, we can still read what we have and come to our own conclusions pertaining to his disposition in that year; nothing could be more first-hand than reading someone\\u2019s writing about their thoughts. Entries from his diaries can be read at en.tchaikovsky-research.net. Luckily for us, he expressed his innermost thoughts almost as freely in his letters to Nadezhda von Meck in later years. As for his compositions, this year, he composed The Snow Maiden (\\u0421\\u043D\\u0435\\u0433\\u0443\\u0440\\u043E\\u0447\\u043A\\u0430), a Russian folk tale; arrangement of his symphony, Oprichnik, for piano, started and finished The Tempest within a few months. Though his musical disposition was not that of a typical nationalist, like the Mighty five, he still considered himself imbued with all the characteristics of a true Russian nationalist. He also noted to Nadezhda von Meck that several folkish aromas in his music are mere results of him having grown up in the country and had as a result, absorbed all those folk qualities. More details about his compositional method are discussed further in the \\u201CMethod\\u201D section of this research. Tchaikovsky had received and would have received several works similar to The Snow Maiden, having stories revolving around folk themes. However, his music was not considered to be \\u201CRussian\\u201D by many. But it was this quality that gave his music its uniqueness, a blend of national ideology and western (non-Russian) music characteristics. Tchaikovsky was aware of the public view towards his music, as noted in his letter to Nadezhda von Meck how he despised the way \\u201CThe Mighty Five\\u201D encapsulated themselves into a small and \\u201Cuntenable\\u201D circle.

His Second Symphony and Oprichnik won the approval of a lot of people. And thanks to these works, starting this year, his name would begin climbing slowly to the top of the Russian artistic circle and would see themselves, among his other works, be included in the main repertory of many opera houses and orchestras. Amongst those approved of his new works were all of the Mighty Five but one: Caesar Cui. Cui\\u2019s criticism was even more severe and slandering in his writing about Oprichnik. Despite the chorus and the orchestra were excellent and the performance was smooth, and the public seemed to show great enthusiasm after the show was over, Cui\\u2019s slandering criticism about Oprichnik nonetheless shook Tchaikovsky: \\u201CThe text might have been the work of a schoolboy, the music is equally immature and undeveloped ...it is such as might have been expected from a beginner...The choruses are rather better than the rest, but this is only because of the folksong element which forms their thematic material....\\u201D (M. Tchaikovsky, pg. 151) What this does is highlight the contrasting difference between someone who is both musically and ideologically nationalist like Cui, and a mixed breed like Tchaikovsky. Tchaikovsky\\u2019s music indeed began to charm an audience of all nationalities. Laroche wrote: \\u201CThe wealth of musical beauties in The Oprichnik is so great that this opera takes a significant place not only among Tchaikovsky\\u2019s own works, but among all the examples of Russian dramatic music\\u2026we have a score which displays many of the best features of modern operatic music, while at the same time it is free from most of the worst faults of contemporary composition.\\u201D ( Allgemeine Zeitung, No. 148, 1874) However, by 1881, the Oprichnik was given already fourteen times, not a single opera from the contemporary Russian composers had exceeded 16, while many had only reached eight. Each year, Tchaikovsky liked to spend his summer away from town life, to take stock of his life, to work on his own projects, listen and enjoy foreign music and performances, and most importantly, to really take in the beauty of nature that was so dear to him. During this summer holiday, Tchaikovsky began composing his new opera Vakoula for a competition held by the directors of the Imperial Musical Society; wanting to erase the memory of his Oprichnik, he hurried to get this new opera done within a year. Why he hated such a successful work, we may never know, but it, alongside his 2nd symphony, had now made him one of the most renowned composers in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg. Several of his other works had also been building fame in foreign lands, as noted by Hans von B\\xFClow: \\u201CA beautiful string quartet by him has won its way in many German towns.

Through this series of letters, the two slowly became closer and closer, as professed by Nadeshda, she would like to know more about the composer and the man he truly was. She however, had zero intentions to meet him; they never saw each other directly, but when they did, they passed as total strangers. (M. Tchaikovsky, pg. 208) Therefore, this special and bizarre situation had made writing letters to each other akin to writing out a diary; both poured out their innermost thoughts without fear of retributions. Nadeshda, after having commissioned Tchaikovsky a number of times, slowly began to take charge of other aspects of Tchaikovsky\\u2019s pecuniary difficulties; she paid his debts of 3000 rubles, securing her place as his sole creditor in the process. As stated by herself in one of her letters to the composer, by helping him, she was in turn helping her, as his existence and his music served as the primary source of enjoyment in her life. Of course, this did not even in the least weaken their friendship. Other than being financially pivotal, this year also proved to be mentally destructive towards Tchaikovsky as well. He decided to marry Antonina Ivanovna Milioukov, but not without protests from his brothers, who were well aware of his homosexuality. This engagement was the result of his caring and sensitive disposition. Through a series of letters, Antonina had shown him her ardent affection for him.

After less than a month of cohabitation, the marriage turned out already to be disastrous. The problem was his lack of foresight; he did not love the girl, nor was he straight. Living with Antonina for only 20 years had almost brought him to the brink of insanity. He left his wife to stay with his sister for a month and a half, before returning and leaving again for good.

This occasion with Kotek was the impetus for the concerto. Kotek also helped Tchaikovsky edit some parts for the concerto. The concerto took him less than 1 month to complete, with only 5 days spent on the first movement.
