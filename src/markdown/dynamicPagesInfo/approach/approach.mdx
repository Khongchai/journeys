<h1 class="main-topic">Introduction</h1>

<div id="Introductionparagraph">

In this section, we shall be looking at Tchaikovsky’s method of composition, inspirations, and motivations. These will serve as the basis for our analysis of his concerto and other folk-inspired works in other sections.

When analyzing someone’s work, our knowledge of music theory, history, and historical contexts play an important role in helping us decipher the hidden musical structures and developments. However, our assumptions can only go so far; no matter how detailed research is conducted, such analysis will inevitably contain a certain number of substantiated assumptions.

**Symphony No.6**

Tchaikovsky's Symphony no. 6 “Pathetique” was compared to Beethoven’s Sonata Pathétique by Hugo Riemann, a German music theorist. His thematic analysis of the symphony describes it as having “striking resemblance”to the work of the German composer. This conjecture could be derived from both compositions sharing the word “Pathetique” in their respective titles. However, we know, from his brother, that this was not the case. And Riemann was not just some music theorist; through his important publications, he coined the terms such as “tonic”, “subdominant”, “dominant” and “parallel”.

In the book Life and Letters of Tchaikovsky his brother Modeste recalls one early morning before Tchaikovksy had to send his 6th symphony to his publisher. Tchaikovsky was not able to decide upon a name for his symphony as he had no intention to “expound any meaning” on the symphony, and he did not want to give it just a number. Modeste, out of the blue, suggested the word “Pathetic”, to which Tchaikovsky saw very fitting for his new symphony (the exact word suggested was Патетическая; Pathetique or other variants are translations in other languages).

**Tchaikovsky's Method of Composition**

<div id="Tchaikovsky's Method of Compositionparagraph">

Collection of letters from composers often serve as invaluable first-hand resources, giving us insight into the mindset behind the creation of many important works. Luckily for us, Tchaikovsky shared his method of composition with Nadezhda von Meck in a letter dated to March 5th, 1878 letter, shortly before he began writing his violin concerto (letter 778), and again, in letters from June 24th and 25th, 1878, a few months after the violin concerto was finished (letter 862 and 863).

From these three letters, we can conclude that when he composed:

- The idea and the instrumentation came together: in his 2nd symphony, the pizzicato in the 3rd movement was exactly how he thought of it (778). 

- The folk-melody, harmonies, or other elements most of the time came by themselves; he did not have any ulterior nationalistic motives to his works. This could be attributed to his childhood having been spent in the country and “having in the earliest years, been impregnated with the characteristic beauty of Russian folk-music… In a word, I am Russian in the fullest sense of the word” (778). 

- Works that stemmed from his own initiative, not commissioned, or requested by friends, such as the concerto, flowed naturally from the brain to the pen, without need contexts or program. On the contrary, commissioned works are necessary for him to “get in the mood” (862).

- Harmonies are dependent on melodic lines and rhythm (862). 

- He did not confine himself to following traditional forms other than separating them into several movements.

- His works were examined, rewritten, shortened, lengthened many times before their final form (863).

Another instance where he talked about his method of composition can be found in a letter to Frau von Meck from February 17th, 1878, though he was responding to her question about his motivation 
behind his 4th symphony that he dedicated to her, not his method of composition per se (letter 763). 

In it, he was asked whether he had a special program in view, and his reply was that he usually had no motives other than his inner musical voice for 
symphonic and instrumental music. Such music was to him, his means of expressing his inner thoughts where words do not suffice; when main ideas manifest, everything 
flows naturally, surroundings and time become forgotten. The entire process was comparable to verses from poets, in that they are in the final form, and any attempt at 
translating it to words could be no more than futile metaphors (763).
