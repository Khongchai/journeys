# Introduction

<p id="Introductionparagraph">

As we have seen in the “method” section, most of the time, the folk elements are mere byproducts of his being exposed constantly to folk music when he was younger and his nationalism. His music is generally said by critics and composers such as Cui, Mussorgsky, Bülow, and acknowledged by him, as having a “folky” style rather than directly incorporating folk melodies, except when the music is about folk music, like his 2nd symphony, 50 Russian folk songs, etc.
What will be looked at first in this section are some tunes that directly and play important parts in his music and their musical characteristics, and then in the subsequent section, native tunes from places he frequented. In the last section we’ll be bringing all information from this research together to help us analyze Tchaikovsky’s violin concerto and see what can be done to realize the goal of this research.

# Tchaikovsky's Concert Music

<p id="Tchaikovsky's Concert Musicparagraph">

The theme of western music often has inner dialogues between inner lines, both melodically and harmonically, creating tensions and resolutions. As certain aspects of a piece become more complex, other parts are molded to complement that change. However, in strict Russian school, this does not happen. Often, in symphonic music composed by those of Russian schools such as Cui, Glinka, Borodin, etc. do not follow this pattern. The entire motivic and harmonic development rely on the structure of the implemented folk tune, in other words, the parts are now not dependent on each other, but entirely on the contour of the main melody. This causes music to repeat itself without clear musical direction. (D. Brown, 1978) 

**The Second Symphony**

<p id="The Second Symphonyparagraph">

In Tchaikovsky’s second symphony, instead of following the traditional Russian school principal, Tchaikovsky opted for a more western approach, playing around, changing and transposing the melody, adding inner conversation between the lines.

The first part of the symphony begins with a slow introduction. Here, a solo horn plays the Ukrainian version of the famous Russian folk song “Down by the Mother Volga”, which kept its form throughout the exposition.   The tune repeats a few times, with each time having different harmonization and instrumentation. Sometimes, the melody stops altogether and breaks off into another completely different theme.

<em class="image-caption">The accompaniment for the 3rd measure of the theme later in the movement.</em>

In the accompaniment, we find something quite interesting: the bassline moves in a melodic fashion, with the inner parts interacting, resolving itself in response to the tensions created by its neighbors. In German music, this would have seemed to be very normal, this harmonic movement is prevalent in music of those such as Brahns, Beethoven, and Bruch. However, for contemporary Russian composers of the century, this was much less common. 

This can also be seen in his other implementation in the symphony. The second movement appears to us as a scene, the extreme sections of which are based on the scene of the wedding procession from the early opera “Undine” that was destroyed by the composer himself. And in the middle section the Russian folk song “Strands, my spinner” (Пряди, моя пряха) was introduced. While the melody remains unchanged, the harmony and embellishment are both colorful, exchanging lines back and forth and forming new background dialogues.

After repeating the themes quite a few times, the themes in Tchaikovsky’s music would see themselves 
slowly develop, following the traditional German thematic development. For 
example, in the part after the introduction of the folk theme in the second movement of his symphony, 
the rhythmic pattern of the folk tune was mimicked and by the succeeding melody(left) which would lead 
into further development and introduction of a new theme (right):

**Russian Music**

These Russian folk music originally have much simpler harmonies. 
For example, in minor keys, we would see i - iv - V very often.  Tcahikovksy’s 
approach was a mix of the melody-dominant traditional Russian school: repeat the main 
theme a few times and change up the accompaniment; and western practice: develop the theme and 
harmonize such that the tensions and resolutions from the background help drive the music forward.

Tchaikovsky had always liked to travel, and on his trip, he would jot down every little idea he had along the way, be it on a piece of paper, or a bank note. (letter 778) This is also evidenced in his other letter he wrote to Nadezhda von Meck during his holiday in Italy (at the time of writing he was in Pisa) after his encounter with a young street singer:

> “I do not remember any simple folk song ever having made such an impression upon me. This time the lad sang me a charming new melody (see the picture above), which I intend to make him sing again, so that I may write it down for my own use on some future occasion.” (letter 765)

Another well-known incorporation of folk music into his work is the inclusion of Во поле береза стояла (In the Field Stood a Birch Tree) as the secondary theme of the last movement of his 4th symphony.

<em class="image-caption">The introduction of the folk song Во поле береза стояла on solo oboe and bassoon.</em>

When the theme repeats again after the first introduction, we see a textural change mainly in the embellishment line: running sixteenth notes are passed back and forth between the string section. The main theme is also doubled with more woodwinds.

This textural development would continue for a few times:

<img class="enlargeable adjacent" src={thirteenthImg} /><img class="enlargeable adjacent" src={fourteenImg} />
</span>

Eventually, the theme is developed, first by transposing the key(top) and then by rhythmic permutations (two in the middle). What we see before the recapitulation of the first theme of the 4th movement is now, after having gone through many developments, is just a melodic contour of the folk theme (bottom):
