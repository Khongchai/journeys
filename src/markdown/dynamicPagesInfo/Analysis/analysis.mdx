<h1 class="main-topic">Introduction</h1>

<p id="Introductionparagraph">

As we have seen in the “method” section, most of the time, the folk elements are mere byproducts of his being exposed constantly to folk music when he was younger and his nationalism. His music is generally said by critics and composers such as Cui, Mussorgsky, Bülow, and acknowledged by him, as having a “folky” style rather than directly incorporating folk melodies, except when the music is about folk music, like his 2nd symphony, 50 Russian folk songs, etc.
What will be looked at first in this section are some tunes that directly and play important parts in his music and their musical characteristics, and then in the subsequent section, native tunes from places he frequented. In the last section we’ll be bringing all information from this research together to help us analyze Tchaikovsky’s violin concerto and see what can be done to realize the goal of this research.

# Tchaikovsky's Concert Music

<p id="Tchaikovsky's Concert Musicparagraph">

The theme of western music often has inner dialogues between inner lines, both melodically and harmonically, creating tensions and resolutions. As certain aspects of a piece become more complex, other parts are molded to complement that change. However, in strict Russian school, this does not happen. Often, in symphonic music composed by those of Russian schools such as Cui, Glinka, Borodin, etc. do not follow this pattern. The entire motivic and harmonic development rely on the structure of the implemented folk tune, in other words, the parts are now not dependent on each other, but entirely on the contour of the main melody. This causes music to repeat itself without clear musical direction. (D. Brown, 1978) 

<p id="The Second Symphonyparagraph">

**The Second Symphony**

In Tchaikovsky’s second symphony, instead of following the traditional Russian school principal, Tchaikovsky opted for a more western approach, playing around, changing and transposing the melody, adding inner conversation between the lines.

The first part of the symphony begins with a slow introduction. Here, a solo horn plays the Ukrainian version of the famous Russian folk song “Down by the Mother Volga”, which kept its form throughout the exposition.   The tune repeats a few times, with each time having different harmonization and instrumentation. Sometimes, the melody stops altogether and breaks off into another completely different theme.

<em class="image-caption">Opening theme of the 1st movement.</em>

<img class="enlargeable" src={secondImg} />
<em class="image-caption">The accompaniment for the 3rd measure of the theme later in the movement.</em>

In the accompaniment, we find something quite interesting: the bassline moves in a melodic fashion, with the inner parts interacting, resolving itself in response to the tensions created by its neighbors. In German music, this would have seemed to be very normal, this harmonic movement is prevalent in music of those such as Brahns, Beethoven, and Bruch. However, for contemporary Russian composers of the century, this was much less common. 

This can also be seen in his other implementation in the symphony. The second movement appears to us as a scene, the extreme sections of which are based on the scene of the wedding procession from the early opera “Undine” that was destroyed by the composer himself. And in the middle section the Russian folk song “Strands, my spinner” (Пряди, моя пряха) was introduced. While the melody remains unchanged, the harmony and embellishment are both colorful, exchanging lines back and forth and forming new background dialogues.

<img class="enlargeable" src={seventhImg} />
<em class="image-caption">Accompaniment II  measure 113 - 116.</em>

After repeating the themes quite a few times, the themes in Tchaikovsky’s music would see themselves 
slowly develop, following the traditional German thematic development. For 
example, in the part after the introduction of the folk theme in the second movement of his symphony, 
the rhythmic pattern of the folk tune was mimicked and by the succeeding melody(left) which would lead 
into further development and introduction of a new theme (right):

<p id="Russian Musicparagraph">

**Russian Music**

These Russian folk music originally have much simpler harmonies. 
For example, in minor keys, we would see i - iv - V very often.  Tcahikovksy’s 
approach was a mix of the melody-dominant traditional Russian school: repeat the main 
theme a few times and change up the accompaniment; and western practice: develop the theme and 
harmonize such that the tensions and resolutions from the background help drive the music forward.

<img class="enlargeable adjacent" src={tenthImg} style={{float: "right"}}/>

Tchaikovsky had always liked to travel, and on his trip, he would jot down every little idea he had along the way, be it on a piece of paper, or a bank note. (letter 778) This is also evidenced in his other letter he wrote to Nadezhda von Meck during his holiday in Italy (at the time of writing he was in Pisa) after his encounter with a young street singer:

> “I do not remember any simple folk song ever having made such an impression upon me. This time the lad sang me a charming new melody (see the picture above), which I intend to make him sing again, so that I may write it down for my own use on some future occasion.” (letter 765)

Another well-known incorporation of folk music into his work is the inclusion of Во поле береза стояла (In the Field Stood a Birch Tree) as the secondary theme of the last movement of his 4th symphony.

<img class="enlargeable large-image-contain" src={eleventhImg} />
<em class="image-caption center">The introduction of the folk song Во поле береза стояла on solo oboe and bassoon.</em>

When the theme repeats again after the first introduction, we see a textural change mainly in the embellishment line: running sixteenth notes are passed back and forth between the string section. The main theme is also doubled with more woodwinds.

<img class="enlargeable large-image-contain" src={twelfthImg} />

<em class="image-caption center">The first repeat of the theme.</em>

This textural development would continue for a few times:

<span class="adjacent-images-container">
<img class="enlargeable adjacent" src={thirteenthImg} /><img class="enlargeable adjacent" src={fourteenImg} />
</span>

Eventually, the theme is developed, first by transposing the key(top) and then by rhythmic permutations (two in the middle). What we see before the recapitulation of the first theme of the 4th movement is now, after having gone through many developments, is just a melodic contour of the folk theme (bottom):

<img class="enlargeable large-image-contain" src={fifteenthImg} />

<span class="adjacent-images-container">
<img class="enlargeable adjacent" src={sixteenthImg} /><img class="enlargeable adjacent" src={seventeenthImg} />
</span>

<img class="enlargeable large-image-contain" src={eighteenthImg} />

These permutations, as we will see in the following analysis of some of the music from the members of “The Mighty Five”, were not at all prevalent in other nationalistic Russian composers.

# Tchaikovksy's Contemporaries

<p id="Tchaikovksy's Contemporariesparagraph">

Mikhail Glinka was very influential in the development of “Russian classical music”. This development aimed to produce a distinct and national sound for Russian music. Notable followers are those such as the “Mighty Five”, which includes Balakirev, Cui, Mussorgsky, Borodin, and Korsakov. 

This school, as described by Tchaikovsky in his letter to Nadezhda von Meck in January 1878, due to their one-sided, lack of proper musical training, and biased admiration of one another, their music had suffered from lack of individuality. (letter 705)

This “lack of individuality”, as Tchaikovsky put it, highlights the difference between their composition styles and, in our case, how they develop simple melodies such as folk tunes.

<p id="Glinka's Karaminskayaparagraph">

**Glinka's Karaminskaya**

The music shares its name with a traditional style of Russian folk dance. And it was the first Russian orchestral work to be based entirely on Russian folk song. This music also served as one of the main inspirations for Tchaikovsky’s 2nd symphony, as it showed how folk songs can be used as symphonic materials. ( Warrack, Symphonies, pg. 17) One of Glinka’s composition Жизнь за царя(A Life for the Tsar)  was also amongst one of his earliest musical impressions from his family’s orchestrion alongside Don Giovanni. (M. Tchaikovsky, pg. 23)

In previous examples of Tchaikovsky’s music, we see how he used harmony and melody to propel his music forward, creating tension and resolution. The themes inside Tchaikovsky’s music felt much more malleable; they seem to bend and adapt into their musical surroundings. On the contrary, Glinka’s music has a relatively more viscous implementation, most notoriously is how the ostinato in his 2nd theme stagnates the motivic development as it would break the character of the theme. Instead, the theme is repeated 75 times with textural developments happening in the background. (Brown, Final, 424)

**Comparisons**

<img class="enlargeable large-image-contain" src={nineteenthImg} />
<em class="image-caption center">The exposition of the 2nd theme..</em>

This theme would repeat several times with varying and colorful accompaniment.

<span class="adjacent-images-container">
<img class="enlargeable adjacent" src={twentiethImg} /><img class="enlargeable adjacent" src={twentyFirstImg} />
</span>

However, several measures later, the theme remains in its same, unchanged form. And this repetition of the main theme can also be seen in the works of the composers from “The Mighty Five” as well.

<img class="enlargeable" src={twentySecondImg} />
<em class="image-caption">Hundreds of measures later, the theme is still repeating itself in the same form.</em>

Again, compare that repetition of theme with Tchaikovksy’s more western approach. Below are the middle theme from the second movement of his 6th symphony from two places, one directly from the exposition, and the other from around the ending of the theme. (B major)

<h1 class="main-topic">Folk Music</h1>

<p id="Folk Musicparagraph">

- This section is an analysis of a few tunes from each of the countries Tchaikovsky had frequented from the year 1870 to 1878. The point of this section is not to prove that the music from those regions influenced Tchaikovsky’s music in any way, but to simply work out their musical structures and contours, so that they can be used in the arrangement process of the fictional concerto.

- A lot of assumptions regarding the harmonic functions will be made, as all existing recordings are modern. It cannot be denied that the harmony employed by the performers in the aforementioned recordings are not affected by external musical influences that had no relationship with folk-music. 

- Folk cultures from the included regions are all rich and full of vitality; however, when dug deep enough, they show some shared inherent musical characteristics such as simple melody, modal harmony, harmonic minor scale, etc. So we will be cherry-picking tunes that are distinct enough in its structure/style to stand out amongst its peers.

### Rule 

- One tune that is known to have been incorporated into his compositions, and one more picked arbitrarily from that region’s repertoire.

### Disclaimer 

- The existing notation of all the songs do not give a complete picture; this research is not a research about the history of folk music, but rather, analyses of “hypothetical” situations using some facts whose outputs are musical arrangements.

- Because folk music are not harmonically complex, unless we see explicitly that all the notes in a bar belong to a certain chord outside of the one, two, four, or five chord, we will try to constrain our harmonic interpretation to only these four chords.

# Ukraine

<p id="Ukraineparagraph">

One of his favorite holiday spots was Davidov's estate (the estate of his sister’s husband), situated in Kamenka, Ukraine. He frequented this place from 1865 until his death in 1893, more than exceeded the goal he had set out in a letter to his sister in 1862:

> “...to come to you for a whole year after my studies are finished to compose a great work in your surroundings.”

Many of his compositions were also composed in the pleasant settings of this estate, such as his String Quartet in B flat, the 2nd symphony, 2nd piano concerto, 1812, among others.

This one does not require many assumptions as we know for a fact that he used music from this Ukraine, also known as Little Russia, in his 2nd symphony, Little Russian. We’ll pick Журавель (The Crane), included in his 2nd symphony; and Ніч яка місячна (Moonlight Night), another famous Ukrainian folk song.
