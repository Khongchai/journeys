<div id="Introductionparagraph">

In this section, we shall be looking at Tchaikovsky’s method of composition, inspirations, and motivations. These will serve as the basis for our analysis of his concerto and other folk-inspired works in other sections.

We will be referring to each of the section as <i>stop</i>. However, when more appropriate, they can also be referred to as movements, so both will be
used interchangeably and they, in the context of this breakdown, mean the same thing.

Tchaikovsky often sneakily adds folk melody to some of his music. So to mirror that, his snippets from his other music will pop up here and there as we listen, so, keep an ear out!

</div>

# Baseline

<div id="Baselineparagraph">

When analyzing someone’s work, our knowledge of music theory, history, and historical contexts play an important role in helping us decipher the hidden musical structures and developments. However, our assumptions can only go so far; no matter how detailed research is conducted, such analysis will inevitably contain a certain number of substantiated assumptions.

<div id="Symphony No.6paragraph" >

<strong id="Symphony No.6">Symphony No.6</strong>

Tchaikovsky's Symphony no. 6 “Pathetique” was compared to Beethoven’s Sonata Pathétique by Hugo Riemann, a German music theorist. His thematic analysis of the symphony describes it as having “striking resemblance”to the work of the German composer. This conjecture could be derived from both compositions sharing the word “Pathetique” in their respective titles. However, we know, from his brother, that this was not the case. And Riemann was not just some music theorist; through his important publications, he coined the terms such as “tonic”, “subdominant”, “dominant” and “parallel”.

<img

/>

In the book Life and Letters of Tchaikovsky his brother Modeste recalls one early morning before Tchaikovksy had to send his 6th symphony to his publisher. Tchaikovsky was not able to decide upon a name for his symphony as he had no intention to “expound any meaning” on the symphony, and he did not want to give it just a number. Modeste, out of the blue, suggested the word “Pathetic”, to which Tchaikovsky saw very fitting for his new symphony (the exact word suggested was Патетическая; Pathetique or other variants are translations in other languages).

</div>

<strong id="Tchaikovsky's Method of Composition">
  Tchaikovsky's Method of Composition
</strong>

<div id="Tchaikovsky's Method of Compositionparagraph">

Collection of letters from composers often serve as invaluable first-hand resources, giving us insight into the mindset behind the creation of many important works. Luckily for us, Tchaikovsky shared his method of composition with Nadezhda von Meck in a letter dated to March 5th, 1878 letter, shortly before he began writing his violin concerto (letter 778), and again, in letters from June 24th and 25th, 1878, a few months after the violin concerto was finished (letter 862 and 863).

From these three letters, we can conclude that when he composed:

- The idea and the instrumentation came together: in his 2nd symphony, the pizzicato in the 3rd movement was exactly how he thought of it (778).

- The folk-melody, harmonies, or other elements most of the time came by themselves; he did not have any ulterior nationalistic motives to his works. This could be attributed to his childhood having been spent in the country and “having in the earliest years, been impregnated with the characteristic beauty of Russian folk-music… In a word, I am Russian in the fullest sense of the word” (778).

- Works that stemmed from his own initiative, not commissioned, or requested by friends, such as the concerto, flowed naturally from the brain to the pen, without need contexts or program. On the contrary, commissioned works are necessary for him to “get in the mood” (862).

- Harmonies are dependent on melodic lines and rhythm (862).

- He did not confine himself to following traditional forms other than separating them into several movements.

- His works were examined, rewritten, shortened, lengthened many times before their final form (863).

Another instance where he talked about his method of composition can be found in a letter to Frau von Meck from February 17th, 1878, though he was responding to her question about his motivation
behind his 4th symphony that he dedicated to her, not his method of composition per se (letter 763).

In it, he was asked whether he had a special program in view, and his reply was that he usually had no motives other than his inner musical voice for
symphonic and instrumental music. Such music was to him, his means of expressing his inner thoughts where words do not suffice; when main ideas manifest, everything
flows naturally, surroundings and time become forgotten. The entire process was comparable to verses from poets, in that they are in the final form, and any attempt at
translating it to words could be no more than futile metaphors (763).

### Disclaimer

- Before we dive into the details, it is important to note that this research does not aim to be historically, theoretically, or artistically accurate.

The arrangement is divided into 5 separate journeys, each with its own research-inspired rationale. The arrangement is meant to be played back to back, however, for the sake
of analysis, in this section, we will look at them individually. The audio, both separate movements, and the entire arrangement are included below alongside their respective section.

<strong id="1st Stop: Prologue">1st Stop: Prologue</strong>

<div id="1st Stop: Prologueparagraph">

In our first journey, we begin with a slightly modified motif and reharmonized orchestral version of the Ukrainian folk song <i>Ніч яка місячна</i>.
As mentioned in the analysis section, Tchaikovsky, when composing, often play around with the idea of thematic development and strict, western reharmonization.
However, the western influence was not the sole source of his inspiration, much of it came also from contemporary influence, both domestic and abroad. Hence, the
more modern sounding harmony, which will be the recurring theme throughout the entire arrangement.

We then moved to a <i>developed</i> version of the main melody, a common approach Tchaikovsky adopted to deal with the repetitions found in folk music.
This is discussed in details in the analysis section.

To pay homage to Tchaikovsky, as well as be inspired by his musical aesthetics, the melody and harmony, in later parts of the arrangement, bring in classical voicings,
harmonies, and other western music-insired elements into it.

This eventual amalgamation of different folk and classical styles, as mentioned in the analysis section, is also prevalent in Tchaikovsky's music. In the two snippets below, we have
the famous trepak dance from the Nutcracker Suite, which features a dance rhythm from the traditional Russian dance of the same name, and a waltz from his 5th symphony, which uses the melody
he discovered by accident as he was <a href="analysis#Italy">touring Italy</a> (more in the Italy section in the analysis page).

Eventually, the ending takes us to the harmonic landscape more familiar to people from the 21st century, reminding the listeners of the theme of this research, Tchaikovsky in the present day.
Of course, it wouldn't be Tchaikovsky without some elements of his in it. In the last part of the arrangement, we have the typical Tchaikovsky's running viola lines, accompanying
a soft and mellow piano solo. Finally, the first journey concludes with a Disney-like string orchestra + balalaika arrangement, accompanying a melody that reminds us a bit of
one of the themes from the Nutcracker.

<div id="2nd Stop: Villageparagraph">

In our second journey, we will take a musical stroll through Eastern European landscape with, again, a sprinkle of modernism. This time, that modernism
manifests not only in the music's harmony but also in its texture.
Modern sound design is a big player in the following arrangement, pulling the listeners to a more surreal and harsh landscape of the parallel 17th-century.

Similar to the previous arrangement, here, the melody from the famous folk tune <i>Коробе́йники</i> is also constantly developoed as the music progressed.

The violin-and-viola-only style of this arrangement has given us more room to play with the color of the instruments, as they can stand out without being muddied by the combined texture
of other instruments in other settings. This textural play, although not common in Tchaikovsky's music, was very common in folk music from many cultures. Or sometimes, where technical limitations prevailed, the unique colors are found, instead, in the sound of the instrument itself.

In our hypothetical scenario, Tchaikovsky not only has access to acoustic instruments, but also amazing tools that are Digital Audio Workstation.
This allows for an even broader range of colors to be included in the music.

As the arrangement goes on, both the harmony and the melody develop hand-in-hand.

    {

This idea will continue for some time, the full version of this (and others) can be listened to at the end of the page.

Eventually, as the melody and the haromny harmony morphs and twists, the arrangement concludes with the melody from the first movement of the violin concerto, followed by a virtuoso cadenza.
This cadenza is accompanied by long drones from the violins, though not with the standard western harmony, reminding the listeners of the alternate reality that is the subject of this research.

<div id="3rd Stop: Forestparagraph">

After the calm ending of the previous movement, we are greeted with an open-string broken chord from a violin with an alternate tuning.
This alternate tuning keeps the sound of the E string and alters the rest. As the sonorous sound of the E string rings and the lower strings hum,
the music pulls and wriggles itself into a position that lingers between two worlds, past (alternate tuning) and present (E string and the accompanying viola).

Then, the music introduces the main theme of the second movement from Tchaikovsky's concerto, but with a different texture altogether.

We can see similar things in some of Tchaikovsky music. In the example below, the melody of the folk music remains intact -- no transformation, while
the accompaniment part changes dramatically.

  dataArray={[
    {
      audioData: secondMovementFolkExample,
      title: "The Very Beginning of Tchaikovsky's 2nd Symphony",

    },
  ]}
  type="original"

In later section of the symphony, the entire texture develops, which a part of what made Tchaikovsky's music stand out from his peers. This is
also reflected in the arrangement.

  dataArray={[
    {
      audioData: secondMovementTransformed,

The rest of this arrangement focuses on the aspect of sound design, while still playing around with the idea of motivic and textural transformation.
A part of the main theme, background, and even the performance style take turn weaving in and out of different styles.

Drawing inspiration from a culture across the globe. There is, as far as I know, no information regarding Tchaikovsky's interaction with the Irish culture. But
this section is the direct result of me having always been infatuated with the cultures' music. As we have seen again and again, that was what Tchaikovsky often did was it not?
Be inspired and create.

The form of this movement is a mixed between the traditional repeating structure of celtic music, where the main melody often repeats many times, each time with different improvisatory ornaments.

In the beginning of the movement we are greeted with a drone and a melody in the tin whistle (this will, later in the piece, become a counter melody).

The exposition of the concerto's melody comes with a constant foot tapping sound, very common in Irish music. When there are accompaniments available, Irish traditional musicians
often resort to tapping their own foot in a constant beat. This tapping is found also in American and Québécois fiddle (the latter also have an even more sophisticated version of tapping while playing).

Other than tapping, folk music puts a lot of emphasis and the P5 open string of the strings. In this piece, they are used so much that the chord that they form together
on the violin, G6/9omit3, can be put anywhere without any noticeable dissonant.

The B part of this movement is a short interlude with a slightly altered melody, accompanied by a long and echoy strings synth. Comparing this to the first stop, there were a lot
of drones, dry ones, but still drones, with a melody that does not at all, deviate from the source material. The narrative then slowly shifts as we move on from the first stop to the last
stop (before the epilogue): the modernism slowly gains more and more emphasis until it eventually become the dominating voice in the structure, while at the same time, retaining some
of the elements we saw at the beginning with it.

This is also the type of journey Tchaikovsky went through. His life, through his early years as a composer, though not entirely, was influenced heavily by the voices and
presence of his colleagues, like the Mighty Five and Anton Rubinstein, however, as years past, his own voice eventually triumphed, and eventually became the composer we know of today.
A composer, whose voice is neither nationalistic nor traditional, but a composer, whose music boasts its own unique musical narrative and texture.

I will not give examples in this regard, as one can easily find out for themselves by listening to any of Tchaikovsky's music from his early days and
compare them to ones composed later in his life, for example the first and last symphonies, <i>Oprichnik</i> and <i>Nutcracker</i>, amongst many. Picking out only a few examples won't do his musical development's justice.

At the end of the movement, the main melody on the tin whistle we heard at the beginning returns as a coutner melody to the concerto's main motif.
This is common in all of classical music, but it is different in Tchaikovsky's music in that all the parts in a polyphony are used some time earlier
in the piece before they come together for a melodically climactic duet.

Our series of journeys conclude with an orchestral arrangement. This section requires the least explanation as it is the most free in terms of form and structure. The epilogue is meant to be like the end credit of a movie, just a nice music accompanying the afterthoughts of the audience.
The main motif is, like the Irish stop, borrowed from the first movement of the concerto. The idea transforms and metamorphs like previous sections, but the interaction between it and the accompaniment part is more free and is less restricted.
