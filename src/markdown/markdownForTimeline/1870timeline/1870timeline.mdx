topic1excerpt: The Outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War had entrapped Tchaikovsky within Swiss territory. It was here that he finished one of the most important works that marked the beginning of a new Tchaikovsky. Luckily, he was able to leave Switzerland within a little more than a month and went to Munich where he stayed with his friend and escaped to St. Petersburg by Vienna.
topic2excerpt: This piece marked a new point in his career as it exceeded its composer in terms of reputation, seeing itself becoming popular in several German towns.
topic3excerpt: The Oprichnik is one of the first ambitious works of Tchaikovksy. It took him 2 years to finish writing and two more years of revisions but the composer still found this work "not worthy". Nonetheless, this opera was monumental in that it, according to Vasily Bessel, "rekindled his interest in the operatic genre".
