topic1excerpt: During a trip to Paris with his brother this year, Tchaikovsky had finally had the chance to satiate his thirst for Carmen. Never had he been ever so excited as that night when Carmen was given in Paris, according to his brother. Carmen also gave him an idea to compose music in a similar setting.
topic2excerpt: No relationship had ever been so poetic, magical, and unique as the one between Frau von Meck and Tchaikovksy. In the December of 1876, through Kotek, Nadezhda von Meck had commissioned Tchaikovksy for some humble works but not humble pay. This was the first contact, though indirect, that was the beginning of Tchaikovsky's new life, for all that he composed after this would owed its existence not to only Tchaikovsky, but von Meck as well.
