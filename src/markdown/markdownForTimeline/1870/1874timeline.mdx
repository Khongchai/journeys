topic1excerpt: The success of his Oprichnik and Second Symphony is felt throughout the first few months of this year and it marked the beginning of his climb to the top of the Russian artistic circle. Though not all critiques were positive, people liked them enough that they were included in the main repertory of many opera houses and orchesrtas.
topic2excerpt: Oprichnik, despite being loved by the crowd, was rejected by its own composer, who seeked to redeem his "awful" work with a new and "better" opera "Vakoula".
topic3excerpt: His fame did not stop at the small German towns we saw in previous section, later this year it began to spread further, finding its way into the heart of even more German towns.
