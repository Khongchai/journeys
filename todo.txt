TODO

set the height of the indicator line to be the height of all elements with 'active' class (height of all + space between)

refactor all the code
refactor mdx to use markdown id instead of html
beautify the chronological biography
add the missing 1876
expand the size of the scroll bar

if all is done, then you may move on to implementing the main timeline 

and implement subsections as well
