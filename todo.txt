bring back timeline after user tapped on the "hide timeline" in window mode
Timeline picture and description:

1. Take care of loading images >> the images now work, but think about the resolution: maybe used fixed? or maybe look again at how css pictures shoudl behave
2. Responsive design for the main page
3. Set media query of the timeline to be different from other pages.
