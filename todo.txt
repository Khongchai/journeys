refactor all the code

14. Think about the side navbar in mobile mode.
16:: does not happen in development:: maybe something to do with something load before another thing...:: dirty hack = if the error exists, refresh page
16 solution = change the parent of all nested ps to div

Where is the hover effect for the main topic in the side content bar?
