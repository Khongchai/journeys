TODO


refactor all the code

if all is done, then you may move on to implementing the main timeline 

why do you have to double quick the "a" to jump from section to section?
try resetting the global z-index to 0

What should be in each section:

research =>  change name to approach, like how you approach the arrangement
analysis => everything concerning the analysis: from folk analysis to the concerto itself


Tell Gatsby to not include the mdx from markdownForTimeline
