TODO


refactor all the code

if all is done, then you may move on to implementing the main timeline 

why do you have to double click the "a" to jump from section to section?
try resetting the global z-index to 0



Timeline indicator
Timeline picture and description <<<<< do description first, easier, then the picture
bring back timeline after user tapped on the "hide timeline" in window mode
