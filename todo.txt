refactor all the code

14. Think about the side navbar in mobile mode.
15. the nav link anchor only works once until user clicks something else...wtf?
16. For the problem with side navbar not loading sometimes = some id tags fail to load....
16:: does not happen in development:: maybe something to do with something load before another thing...:: dirty hack = if the error exists, refresh page
16 solution = change the parent of all nested ps to div

Where is the hover effect for the main topic in the side content bar?
