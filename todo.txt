TODO


refactor all the code
beautify the chronological biography
expand the size of the scroll bar
come up with subsections (with h4 heading) for all sections
only show the subsections when the user is in those sections - for now only 1872 has that, so try with that first.

if all is done, then you may move on to implementing the main timeline 

and implement subsections for side bar as well

why do you have to double quick the "a" to jump from section to section?
