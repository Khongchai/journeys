TODO

set the height of the indicator line to be the height of all elements with 'active' class (height of all + space between)

refactor all the code
beautify the chronological biography
expand the size of the scroll bar

if all is done, then you may move on to implementing the main timeline 

and implement subsections for side bar as well

why do you have to double quick the "a" to jump from section to section?
